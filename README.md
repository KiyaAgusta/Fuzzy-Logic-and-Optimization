# Fuzzy Logic and Optimisation

This repository was developed by **I Made Akira Ivandio Agusta (15406525),** Coventry University.

**Part 1 (Fuzzy Logic)** provides the **Fuzzy Inference System (FIS)** file for **Smart Bathroom Control**. The system includes 7 input variables, 5 output variables, and 83 rules. Open this file using MATLAB's Fuzzy Logic Toolbox.

**Part 2 (Optimisation)** examines the performance of three optimisation algorithms **(Particle Swarm Optimisation, Genetic Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing)** on three benchmark functions **(F1 Sphere, F9 Rastrigin, and F6 Rosenbrock)** derived from the [CEC 2005](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~nikolaus.hansen/Tech-Report-May-30-05.pdf) test suite. The main execution file is **main.m**. Run this file to produce results and visualisations.
